Second - complete the GREEN column if your answer from the YELLOW column was 'Maybe' or 'Yes.'  When completing the GREEN column, select 'Items' if you are interested in or like working with ITEMS or THINGS; select 'Interpersonal' if you like working with PEOPLE or INTERPERSONAL related tasks; and select 'Ideas/Info' if you like or are interested in working with 'Items', 'Interpersonal' or 'Ideas/Info.'  It is also important to remember that when you are selecting an interest or like, related to 'Items', 'Interpersonal' or 'Ideas/Info', that you consider it as it is related to the job in the first column.  For example - under 'General Business', lets say you chose 'Yes' in the YELLOW column for 'Sales.'  That means your next step is to select a choice in the GREEN column and decide if you would most like to work with 'Items' or 'Interpersonal' or 'Ideas/Info' in a 'Sales' related job. If you would like to add a topic for 'Other' - enter your topic and select a YELLOW and or GREEN value as well.",
