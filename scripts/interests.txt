[description]
This Interests & Adorations assessment will indicate what categories interest you most. You will answer a series of questions which will yield a yellow choice denoting your level of interest. Then you will mark a green answer which shows the type of interest you have for each category. 
[instructions]
First - complete the YELLOW column by selecting the choice that corresponds to your answer:  'No' = You have NO interest in the job in the left column; 'Maybe' = You MIGHT have an interest or a SLIGHT interest; and 'Yes' = You ARE interested in the job from the first column.  Second - complete the GREEN column if your answer from the YELLOW column was 'Maybe' or 'Yes.'  When completing the GREEN column, select 'Items' if you are interested in or like working with ITEMS or THINGS; select 'Interpersonal' if you like working with PEOPLE or INTERPERSONAL related tasks; and select 'Ideas/Info' if you like or are interested in working with 'Items', 'Interpersonal' or 'Ideas/Info.'  It is also important to remember that when you are selecting an interest or like, related to 'Items', 'Interpersonal' or 'Ideas/Info', that you consider it as it is related to the job in the first column.  For example - under 'General Business', lets say you chose 'Yes' in the YELLOW column for 'Sales.'  That means your next step is to select a choice in the GREEN column and decide if you would most like to work with 'Items' or 'Interpersonal' or 'Ideas/Info' in a 'Sales' related job. If you would like to add a topic for 'Other' - enter your topic and select a YELLOW and or GREEN value as well.
